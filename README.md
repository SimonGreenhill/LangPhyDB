## Scope

Any study using computational phylogenetic methods on languages data to 

1. Build a tree or network
2. Fit data (linguistic, cultural, otherwise) onto a tree or network.

Review and tutorial papers that discuss either of these topics are also included.

Note that critical studies are currently not included, see [here for discussion](https://github.com/SimonGreenhill/LangPhyDB/issues/10). 

## Types of Studies Included:

* `phylogenetic`: Studies that aim to infer a phylogeny.
* `network`: Studies that aim to infer a phylogenetic network.
* `dating`: Studies that perform phylogenetic dating.
* `phylogeography`: Studies that aim to infer a phylogeographic homeland.
* `macroevolutionary`: Studies that infer macroevolutionary processes.
* `trait`: Studies that model the history of a particular cultural or linguistic trait(s).
* `review`: A review style article that discusses the above studies
* `tutorial`: A tutorial style article that describes how to do these studies.
