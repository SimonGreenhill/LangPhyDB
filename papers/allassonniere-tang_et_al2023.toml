abstract = """
Numeral classifiers are one of the most common types of nominal
classification systems. Their geographical distribution worldwide is
concentrated in Asia, which infers a scheme of diffusion from a linguistic
innovation. This study investigates the origin of classifier systems in the
Mongolic, Tungusic, and Turkic languages in the Altaic region with a
phylogenetic analysis based on data from 55 languages. The Single Origin
Hypothesis suggests that Sinitic is the most probable original source of
classifier systems found in Asia (Her & Li 2023). Under this hypothesis,
classifiers are unlikely to be an indigenous feature of the Altaic region, and
indeed their phylogenetic signal turns out to be weak. We also conduct a
qualitative analysis on the classifier inventory of the studied languages to
assess the robustness of phylogenetic methods. The results also indicate that
classifiers are most likely a borrowed feature in the Mongolic, Tungusic, and
Turkic languages.
