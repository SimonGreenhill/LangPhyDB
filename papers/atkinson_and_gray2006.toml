abstract = """
There are two main theories of Indo-European origin â€“ the Kurgan and Anatolian hypotheses. Archaeological, genetic
and linguistic evidence has been unable to resolve the debate about Indo-European origins. Here we describe how
likelihood models of lexical evolution, Bayesian inference of phylogeny and rate smoothing algorithms can be used
to estimate the age of the Indo-European language family, and thus test between the time depth predictions of the
Kurgan and Anatolian hypotheses. Estimated divergence times are consistent with the Anatolian theory of
Indo-European origin. We evaluate the robustness of this result and address some potential criticisms of our
approach. We argue that the use of a large number of high quality lexical characters, numerous calibration points,
appropriate likelihood models and rate smoothing make the previously intractable problem of estimating divergence
dates quite solvable.
