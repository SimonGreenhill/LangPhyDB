title = "Cultural and Environmental Predictors of Pre- European Deforestation on Pacific Islands"

doi = "10.1371/journal.pone.0156340"

abstract = """
The varied islands of the Pacific provide an ideal natural experiment for studying the factors shaping human
impact on the environment. Previous research into pre-European deforestation across the Pacific indicated a
major effect of environment but did not account for cultural variation or control for dependencies in the data
due to shared cultural ancestry and geographic proximity. The relative importance of environment and culture on
Pacific deforestation and forest replacement and the extent to which environmental impact is con- strained by
cultural ancestry therefore remain unexplored. Here we use comparative phylogenetic methods to model the effect of
nine ecological and two cultural variables on pre-European Pacific forest outcomes at 80 locations across 67
islands. We show that some but not all ecological features remain important predictors of forest outcomes after
accounting for cultural covariates and non-independence in the data. Controlling for ecology, cultural variation
in agricultural intensification predicts deforestation and forest replacement, and there is some evidence that
land tenure norms predict forest replacement. These findings indicate that, alongside ecology, cultural factors
also predict pre-European Pacific forest outcomes. Although forest outcomes covary with cultural ancestry, this
effect disappears after controlling for geographic proximity and ecology. This suggests that forest out- comes
were not tightly constrained by colonistsâ€™ cultural ancestry, but instead reflect a combination of ecological
constraints and the short-term responses of each culture in the face of those constraints.
