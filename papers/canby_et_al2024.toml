abstract = """
Understanding how languages change is important not
only for the reconstruction of protolanguages and for
estimating diversification dates (i.e. the dates when
languages split), but also for the inference of
evolutionary trees (or phylogenetic networks) of
language families. We propose a parametric model of
language change that addresses lexical polymorphism
(two or more words for a given basic meaning) based on
what is known about how languages change. Under our
model, changes of state in lexical characters occur
only due to semantic shift or borrowing, leading to
(potentially brief) periods in which polymorphism is
present. Across a wide range of model conditions, we
find that a simple and natural modification to the
maximum parsimony (MP) criterion (which seeks the tree
with the fewest number of changes) to allow it to
handle polymorphic characters has the best accuracy,
substantially improving on well-known Bayesian methods
based on appearances and disappearances of words. We
also provide a new analysis of Indoâ€“European that takes
polymorphism into account, finding support for a
previous tree (Nakhleh et al., 2006) and a new tree
that differs from the previous tree in the relationship
between Italo-Celtic and Tocharian.
