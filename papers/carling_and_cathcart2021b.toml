abstract = """
This study uses phylogenetic methods adopted from computational biology in order
to reconstruct features of Proto-Indo-European morphosyntax. We estimate the
probability of the presence of typological features in Proto-Indo-European on the
assumption that these features change according to a stochastic process governed
by evolutionary transition rates between them. We compare these probabilities to
previous reconstructions of Proto-Indo-European morphosyntax, which use either the
comparative-historical method or implicational typology. We find that our
reconstruction yields strong support for a canonical model (synthetic,
nominative-accusative, headfinal) of the protolanguage and low support for any
alternative model. Observing the evolutionary dynamics of features in our data
set, we conclude that morphological features have slower rates of change, whereas
syntactic traits change faster. Additionally, more frequent, unmarked traits in
grammatical hierarchies have slower change rates when compared to less frequent,
marked ones, which indicates that universal patterns of economy and frequency
impact language change within the family.
