abstract = """
Discussion of Indo-European origins and dispersal focuses on two hypotheses.
Qualitative evidence from reconstructed vocabulary and correlations with
archaeological data suggest that IndoEuropean languages originated in the
Pontic-Caspian steppe and spread together with cultural innovations associated
with pastoralism, beginning c. 6500–5500 bp. An alternative hypothesis, according
to which Indo-European languages spread with the diffusion of farming from
Anatolia, beginning c. 9500–8000 bp, is supported by statistical phylogenetic and
phylogeographic analyses of lexical traits. The time and place of the
Indo-European ancestor language therefore remain disputed. Here we present a
phylogenetic analysis in which ancestry constraints permit more accurate
inference of rates of change, based on observed changes between ancient or
medieval languages and their modern descendants, and we show that the result
strongly supports the steppe hypothesis. Positing ancestry constraints also
reveals that homoplasy is common in lexical traits, contrary to the assumptions
of previous work. We show that lexical traits undergo recurrent evolution due to
recurring patterns of semantic and morphological change
