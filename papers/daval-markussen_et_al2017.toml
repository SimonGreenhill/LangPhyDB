abstract = """
In creole studies, there has been a long tradition of discussing the respective
contributions of African languages in the genesis of creoles spoken primarily
in the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans. Creolists have often assumed that the
African languages that contributed to the creation of creoles were typologically
rather uniform (e.g. Singler 1988). Very few studies have compared more than
a handful of languages when searching for African influences in creoles (e.g.
Parkvall 2000). In this chapter, we investigate the claim that the African languages
involved in the colonial settings, and hence in the creation of various
creole languages, were typologically homogeneous. Moreover, we assess the
extent to which a selection of proposed stable features is shared (i) between cre-
oles with and without African influence, (ii) between creoles and West African
languages known to have influenced these creoles, and finally, (iii) between
creoles and their lexifiers.
