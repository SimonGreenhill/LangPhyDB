abstract = """
This paper shows that despite evidence of structural convergence between some of
the Austronesian and non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages of Island Melanesia,
statistical methods can detect two independent genealogical signals derived from
linguistic structural features. Earlier work by the author and others has
presented a maximum parsimony analysis which gave evidence for a genealogical
connection between the non-Austronesian languages of island Melanesia. Using the
same data set, this paper demonstrates for the non-statistician the application
of more sophisticated statistical techniquesâ€”including Bayesian methods of
phylogenetic inference, and shows that the evidence for common ancestry is if
anything stronger than originally supposed.
