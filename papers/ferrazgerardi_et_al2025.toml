Introduction
This study investigates the Je language family and Macro-Je phylum, addressing a significant gap in previous research by applying quantitative methods to its classification.
Dataset

The study compares a subset of 303 concepts from 14 languages, primarily sourced from Swadesh lists and culturally relevant terms, providing a robust foundation for phylogenetic analysis.
Methods

Bayesian phylogenetic inference and NeighborNet methods were employed to analyze the dataset. These approaches enabled the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships within the Je family, facilitating the identification of language divergence patterns and their historical dynamics.
Results

The analysis reveals well-supported Northern, Central, and Southern subgroups within the Je family, demonstrating clear geographical clustering. The phylogenetic tree aligns with existing hypotheses while offering new insights into the family's structure.
Discussion

The findings were contextualized within pre-Columbian archaeological frameworks, drawing parallels between linguistic divergence and material culture. These connections support the hypothesis that the Je language family's development aligns with distinct cultural and geographical distributions observed in archaeological records.
Conclusion and Future Directions

This study affirms the genetic coherence of the Je family and highlights opportunities for future research, including the incorporation of non-Je languages in the Macro-Je phylum and expanded datasets to refine the understanding of this diverse linguistic group.
