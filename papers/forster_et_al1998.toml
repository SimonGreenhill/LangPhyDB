abstract = """ The tree model and the wave model of language evolution are united into one geometric network
model. A related approach has previously been used for reconstructing DNA evolution, and we now present a network
approach for diagnostic word lists of closely related languages. When applied to 17 Alpine Romance languages, the
resulting evolutionary network reproduces known linguistic relationships and also fairly accurately reflects the
geographic location of each language """
