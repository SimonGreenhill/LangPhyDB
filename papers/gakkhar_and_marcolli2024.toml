We study phylogenetic signal present in syntactic information by considering the
syntactic structures data from Longobardi (Linguist Anal 41:517â€“557, 2017), Collins
(Syntactic structures of the world's language: a cross-linguistic database. 27 September
(2010), Colloquium:
https://ling.yale.edu/syntactic-structures-worlds-language-cross-linguistic-database,
2010), Ceolin et al. (Front Psychol 11:2384, 2020) and Koopman (SSWL syntactic structures
of the world's languages: an open-ended database for the linguistic community and by the
linguistic community. mit 50, 12. http://sswl.railsplayground.net/, 2011). Focusing first
on the general Markov models, we explore how well the the syntactic structures data
conform to the hypothesis required by these models. We do this by comparing derived
phylogenetic trees against trees agreed on by the linguistics community. We then
interpret the methods of Ceolin et al. (2020) as an infinite sites evolutionary model and
compare the consistency of the data with this alternative. The ideas and methods
discussed in the present paper are more generally applicable than to the specific setting
of syntactic structures, and can be used in other contexts, when analyzing consistency of
data with against hypothesized evolutionary models.
