abstract = """
The Uto-Aztecan language family is one of the largest language families in the Americas. How- ever, there has been
considerable debate about its origin and how it spread. Here we use Bayesian phylogenetic methods to analyze
lexical data from thirty-four Uto-Aztecan varieties and two Kiowa-Tanoan languages. We infer the age of
Proto-Uto-Aztecan to be around 4,100 years (3,258â€“5,025 years) and identify the most likely homeland to be near
what is now Southern Cali- fornia. We reconstruct the most probable subsistence strategy in the ancestral
Uto-Aztecan society and infer no casual or intensive cultivation, an absence of cereal crops, and a primary
subsistence mode of gathering (rather than agriculture). Our results therefore support the timing, geography, and
cultural practices of a northern origin and are inconsistent with alternative scenarios.
