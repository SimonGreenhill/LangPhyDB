title = "Language trees with sampled ancestors support a hybrid model for the origin of Indo-European languages"

doi = "10.1126/science.abg0818"

abstract = """
The origins of the Indo-European language family are hotly disputed. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of
core vocabulary have produced conflicting results, with some supporting a
farming expansion out of Anatolia ~9000 years before present (yr B.P.), while others support a
spread with horse-based pastoralism out of the Pontic-Caspian Steppe ~6000 yr B.P. Here we
present an extensive database of Indo-European core vocabulary that eliminates past inconsistencies in cognate
coding. Ancestry-enabled phylogenetic analysis of this dataset indicates that few ancient languages are direct
ancestors of modern clades and produces a root age of ~8120 yr B.P. for the family. Although this date is not
consistent with the Steppe hypothesis, it does not rule out an initial homeland south of the Caucasus, with a
subsequent branch northward onto the steppe and then across Europe. We reconcile this hybrid hypothesis with
recently published ancient DNA evidence from the steppe and the northern Fertile Crescent. 
Languages of the Indo-European family are spoken by almost half of the world's population, but their origins and
patterns of spread are disputed. Heggarty et al. present a database of 109 modern and 52 time-calibrated
historical Indo-European languages, which they analyzed with models of Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Their
results suggest an emergence of Indo-European languages around 8000 years before present. This is a deeper root
date than previously thought, and it fits with an initial origin south of the Caucasus followed by a branch
northward into the Steppe region. These findings lead to a "hybrid hypothesis" that reconciles current linguistic
and ancient DNA evidence from both the eastern Fertile Crescent (as a primary source) and the steppe (as a
secondary homeland). —SNV Indo-European languages emerged south of the Caucasus around 8300 years ago, followed
by an expansion northward to the Steppe regions.
