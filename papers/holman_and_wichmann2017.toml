abstract = """
Since the early 1970s, biologists have debated whether evolution is punctuated by speciation events with bursts of
cladogenetic changes, or whether evolution tends to be of a more gradual, anagenetic nature. A similar discussion
among linguists has barely begun, but the present results suggest that there is also room for controversy over this
issue in linguistics. The only previous study correlated the number of nodes in linguistic phylogenies with branch
lengths and found support for punctuated equilibrium. We replicate this result for branch lengths, but find no
support for punctuated equilibrium using a different, automated measure of linguistic divergence and a much larger
data set. With the automated measure, segments of trees containing more nodes show no greater divergence from an
outgroup than segments containing fewer nodes.
