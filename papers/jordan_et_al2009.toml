abstract = """
The nature of social life in human prehistory is elusive, yet knowing how kinship systems evolve is critical
for understanding population history and cultural diversity. Post-marital residence rules specify
sex-specific dispersal and kin association, influencing the pattern of genetic markers across populations.
Cultural phylogenetics allows us to practise 'virtual archaeology' on these aspects of social life that
leave no trace in the archaeological record. Here we show that early Austronesian societies practised
matrilocal post-marital residence. Using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo comparative method implemented in a
Bayesian phylogenetic framework, we estimated the type of residence at each ancestral node in a sample of
Austronesian language trees spanning 135 Pacific societies. Matrilocal residence has been hypothesized for
proto-Oceanic society (ca 3500 BP), but we find strong evidence that matrilocality was predominant in
earlier Austronesian societies ca 5000â€“4500 BP, at the root of the language family and its early branches.
Our results illuminate the divergent patterns of mtDNA and Y-chromosome markers seen in the Pacific. The
analysis of present-day cross-cultural data in this way allows us to directly address cultural evolutionary
and life-history processes in prehistory.
