abstract = """
In this section, I would like to sum up the main insights and achievements of the
semantics section of the book (Chapters 13â€“15) and give suggestions for future
work. I would also like to critically reflect on the limits, problems and obstacles
for utilizing phylogenetic analysis, and at the same time highlight some of the
promises, and potentials for integrating lexical and semantic evidence in the study
of postcolonial linguistic communities.
