This chapter provides a lexical-semantic comparison of a selection of Englishes and English-related creoles in the
Australia-Pacific area. Faced with the co- nundrum in sociolinguistic classificatory practice and its contested
categories: "language", "creole", "dialect", "variety", and "English(es)", we will attempt to circumvent the
problematic of metavocabulary by taking a new, two-pronged approach. Firstly, we rely on semantic primes, simple
words meanings such as I, you, people, body, big, small, know, think, see, hear as our comparandum, and compare
and contrast the lexicalizations of these basic meanings across our sample. Secondly, we utilize phylogenetic
networks for visualizing our results and as a tool for forming new hypotheses. Our results provide counter-evi-
dence to the claim that Melanesian and Australian creoles are "varieties of English". In our sample, we find three
basic types of relations. "Shared-core" types (Australian English v. New Zealand English); "closely related core"
types (Hawai'i Creole v. Anglo Englishes); and "distantly related core" types (Tok Pisin v. Anglo English, Kriol
v. Anglo English, or Yumplatok v. Anglo English). We measure our results against Scandinavian languages in order
to explore the language-dialect question, and against Trinidadian â€“ a Caribbean creole, in or- der to explore the
extent of lexical-semantic areality. We conclude that current sociolinguistic metavocabulary is inadequate for
representing the complexity of the new ways of speaking in the Australia-Pacific region, and we suggest a
principled areal-semantic investigation of words based on semantic principles.
