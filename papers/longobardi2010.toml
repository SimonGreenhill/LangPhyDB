Objective: To propose a new approach for comparing genetic and linguistic diversity in populations belonging to
distantly related groups. Background: Comparisons of linguistic and genetic differences have proved powerful tools to
reconstruct human demographic history. Current models assume on both sides that similarities reflect either descent
from common ancestry or the balance between isolation and contact. Most linguistic phylogenies are ultimately based on
lexical evidence (roughly, words and morphemes with their sounds and meanings). However, measures of lexical divergence
are reliable only for closely related languages, thus large-scale comparisons of genetic and linguistic diversity have
appeared problematic so far. Methods: Syntax (abstract rules to combine words into sentences) appears more measurable,
universally comparable, and stable than the lexicon, and hence certain syntactic similarities might reflect deeper
linguistic relationships, such as those between distant language families. In this study, we for the first time
compared genetic data to a matrix of syntactic differences among selected populations of three continents. Results:
Comparing two databases of microsatellite (Short Tandem Repeat) markers and Single Nucleotides Polymorphisms (SNPs),
with a linguistic matrix based on the values of 62 grammatical parameters, we show that there is indeed a correlation
of syntactic and genetic distances. We also identified a few outliers and suggest a possible interpretation of the
overall pattern. Conclusions: These results strongly support the possibility of better investigating population history
by combining genetic data with linguistic information of a new type, provided by a theoretically more sophisticated
method to assess the relationships between distantly related languages and language families.
