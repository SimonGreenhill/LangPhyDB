title = "Across language families: Genome diversity mirrors linguistic variation within Europe"

doi = "10.1002/ajpa.22758"

abstract = """
The notion that patterns of linguistic and biological variation may cast light on each other and on
population histories dates back to Darwinâ€™s times; yet, turning this intuition into a proper research
program has met with serious methodological difficulties, especially affecting language comparisons.
This article takes advantage of two new tools of comparative linguistics: a refined list of
Indo-European cognate words, and a novel method of language comparison estimating linguistic diversity
from a universal inventory of grammatical polymorphisms, and hence enabling comparison even across
different families. We corroborated the method and used it to compare patterns of linguistic and genomic
variation in Europe. Materials and Methods: Two sets of linguistic distances, lexical and syntactic,
were inferred from these data and compared with measures of geographic and genomic distance through a
series of matrix correlation tests. Linguistic and genomic trees were also estimated and compared. A
method (Treemix) was used to infer migration episodes after the main population splits. Results: We
observed significant correlations between genomic and linguistic diversity, the latter inferred from
data on both Indo-European and non-Indo-European languages. Contrary to previous observations, on the
European scale, language proved a better predictor of genomic differences than geography. Inferred
episodes of genetic admixture following the main population splits found convincing correlates also in
the linguistic realm. Discussion: These results pave the ground for previously unfeasible
crossdisciplinary analyses at the worldwide scale, encompassing populations of distant language families.
