title = "Correlated Evolution Or Not? Phylogenetic Linguistics With Syntactic, Cognacy, And Phonetic Data"

doi = "http://evolang.org/neworleans/papers/162.html"

abstract = """ In this work we compare, on the well explored domain of Indo-European
languages, the phylogenetic outputs of three different sets of linguistic characters:
traditional etymological judgments, a system for phonetic alignment of lists of cognates,
and a set of values for generative syntactic parameters. The correlation and relative
informativeness of distances and phylogenies generated by the three types of characters
can thus be for the first time accurately evaluated, and the degree of success of the
last two, innovative, alternatives to the classical comparative method can be so
assessed. """
