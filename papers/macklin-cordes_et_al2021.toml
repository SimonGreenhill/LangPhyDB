abstract = """
Phylogenetic methods have broad potential in linguistics beyond tree infer- ence. Here, we show how
a phylogenetic approach opens the possibility of gaining historical insights from entirely new
kinds of linguistic data â€“ in this instance, statistical phonotactics. We extract phonotactic data
from 112 Pama-Nyungan vocabularies and apply tests for phylogenetic signal, quanti- fying the
degree to which the data reflect phylogenetic history. We test three datasets: (1) binary variables
recording the presence or absence of biphones (two-segment sequences) in a lexicon (2) frequencies
of transitions between segments, and (3) frequencies of transitions between natural sound classes.
Australian languages have been characterized as having a high degree of phonotactic homogeneity.
Nevertheless, we detect phylogenetic signal in all datasets. Phylogenetic signal is greater in
finer-grained frequency data than in binary data, and greatest in natural-class-based data. These
results demonstrate the viability of employing a new source of readily extractable data in
historical and comparative linguistics.
