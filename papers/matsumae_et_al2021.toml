title = "Exploring correlations in genetic and cultural variation across language families in northeast Asia"

doi = "10.1126/sciadv.abd9223"

abstract = """Culture evolves in ways that are analogous to, but distinct from, genomes. Previous
studies examined similarities between cultural variation and genetic variation (population
history) at small scales within language families, but few studies have empirically investigated
these parallels across language families using diverse cultural data. We report an analysis
comparing culture and genomes from in and around northeast Asia spanning 11 language families. We
extract and summarize the variation in language (grammar, phonology, lexicon), music (song
structure, performance style), and genomes (genome-wide SNPs) and test for correlations. We find
that grammatical structure correlates with population history (genetic history). Recent contact
and shared descent fail to explain the signal, suggesting relationships that arose before the
formation of current families. Our results suggest that grammar might be a cultural indicator of
population history while also demonstrating differences among cultural and genetic relationships
that highlight the complex nature of human history. """
