title = "Best practices in justifying calibrations for dating language families"

doi = "10.1093/jole/lzz009"

abstract = """ The use of computational methods to assign absolute datings to language divergence is
receiving renewed interest, as modern approaches based on Bayesian statistics offer alternatives to the
discredited techniques of glottochronology. The datings provided by these new analyses depend crucially on
the use of calibration, but the methodological issues surrounding calibration have received comparatively
little attention. Especially, underappreciated is the extent to which traditional historical linguistic
scholarship can contribute to the calibration process via loanword analysis. Aiming at a wide audience, we
provide a detailed discussion of calibration theory and practice, evaluate previously used calibrations,
recommend best practices for justifying calibrations, and provide a concrete example of these practices via
a detailed derivation of calibrations for the Uralic language family. This article aims to inspire a higher
quality of scholarship surrounding all statistical approaches to language dating, and especially closer
engagement between practitioners of statistical methods and traditional historical linguists, with the
former thinking more carefully about the arguments underlying their calibrations and the latter more
clearly identifying results of their work which are relevant to calibration, or even suggesting
calibrations directly. """
