abstract = """
Although borrowing and contact are recognised as important factors in language histories, there is no
clear and agreed way of dealing with their effects on methods like traditional lexicostatistics. We
argue that one promising approach involves subdividing standard meaning-lists into more and less
conservative sublists. Differences between trees or networks generated from these sublists may then
indicate borrowing. This approach has been tested on Indo-European, but here we apply it to languages
of the Andes in an attempt to answer the vexed Quechumara question: are Quechua and Aymara genetically
related, or linked only by contact? Our evidence suggests that contact is the more likely explanation
for parallels between Quechua and Aymara.
