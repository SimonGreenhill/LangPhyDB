title = "Dated Ancestral Trees from Binary Trait Data and Their Application to the Diversification of Languages"

abstract = """

Binary trait data record the presence or absence of distinguishing traits in individuals. We treat the
problem of estimating ancestral trees with time depth from binary trait data. Birth times of traits
visible in taxa are biased towards the leaves of the tree by the requirement that the trait survived to be
observed. Unique traits, displayed at a single taxon, are commonly discarded. We model the evolution of
binary traits as a birth-death process acting on the elements of sets of traits.The marginal prior
distribution if the root time is uniform. We illustrate Bayesian inference for two binary-trait data
sets which arise in historical linguistics. Model mispecification analysis is based in part on
predictive distributions with external data, and related to distinctive features of the observation
model.
