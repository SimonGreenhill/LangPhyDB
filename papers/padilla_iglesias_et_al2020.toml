abstract = """
The origins of linguistic diversity remain controversial. Studies disagree on whether group features such as
population size or social structure accelerate or decelerate linguistic differentiation. While some analyses of
between-group factors highlight the role of geographical isolation and reduced linguistic exchange in differentiation,
others suggest that linguistic divergence is driven primarily by warfare among neighbouring groups and the use of language
as marker of group identity. Here we provide the first integrated test of the effects of five historical sociodemographic
and geographic variables on three measures of linguistic diversification among 50 Austronesian languages: rates of word
gain, loss and overall lexical turnover. We control for their shared evolutionary histories through a time-calibrated
phylogenetic sister-pairs approach. Results show that languages spoken in larger communities create new words at a faster
pace. Within-group conflict promotes linguistic differentiation by increasing word loss, while warfare hinders linguistic
differentiation by decreasing both rates of word gain and loss. Finally, we show that geographical isolation is a strong
driver of lexical evolution mainly due to a considerable drift-driven acceleration in rates of word loss. We conclude that
the motor of extreme linguistic diversity in Austronesia may have been the dispersal of populations across relatively
isolated islands, favouring strong cultural ties amongst societies instead of warfare and cultural group marking.
