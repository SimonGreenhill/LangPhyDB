title = "Ultraconserved words point to deep language ancestry across Eurasia"

doi = "10.1073/pnas.1218726110"

abstract = """The search for ever deeper relationships abstract the World's languages is bedeviled by
the fact that most words evolve too rapidly to preserve evidence of their ancestry beyond 5,000 to
9,000 y. On the other hand, quantitative modeling indicates that some "ultraconserved" words exist
that might be used to find evidence for deep linguistic relationships beyond that time barrier. Here
we use a statistical model, which takes into account the frequency with which words are used in
common everyday speech, to predict the existence of a set of such highly conserved words among seven
language families of Eurasia postulated to form a linguistic superfamily that evolved from a common
ancestor around 15,000 y ago. We derive a dated phylogenetic tree of this proposed superfamily with a
time-depth of âˆ¼14,450 y, implying that some frequently used words have been retained in related forms
since the end of the last ice age. Words used more than once per 1,000 in everyday speech were 7 to
10-times more likely to show deep ancestry on this tree. Our results suggest a remarkable fidelity in
the transmission of some words and give theoretical justification to the search for features of
language that might be preserved across wide spans of time and geography. """
