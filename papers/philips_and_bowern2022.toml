title = "Bayesian methods for ancestral state reconstruction in morphosyntax: Exploring the history of argument marking strategies in a large language family"

doi = "10.1093/jole/lzac002"

abstract = """
Bayesian phylogenetic methods have been gaining traction and currency in historical linguistics, as
their potential for uncovering elements of language change is increasingly understood. Here, we 
demonstrate a proof of concept for using ancestral state reconstruction methods to reconstruct changes
in morphology. We use a simple Brownian motion model of character evolution to test how splits in
ergative marking evolve across Pama-Nyungan, a large family of Australian languages. We are able to
recover linguistically plausible paths of change, as well as rejecting implausible paths. The results
of these analyses elucidate constraints on changes that have led to extensive synchronic variation in
an interlocking morphological system. They further provide evidence of an ergativeâ€“accusative split
traceable to Proto-Pama-Nyungan."""
