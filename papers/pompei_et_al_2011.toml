title = "On the Accuracy of Language Trees"

abstract = """
Historical linguistics aims at inferring the most likely language phylogenetic tree starting from
information concerning the evolutionary relatedness of languages. The available information are
typically lists of homologous (lexical, phonological, syntactic) features or characters for many
different languages: a set of parallel corpora whose compilation represents a paramount achievement
in linguistics. From this perspective the reconstruction of language trees is an example of inverse
problems: starting from present, incomplete and often noisy, information, one aims at inferring the
most likely past evolutionary history. A fundamental issue in inverse problems is the evaluation of
the inference made. A standard way of dealing with this question is to generate data with
artificial models in order to have full access to the evolutionary process one is going to infer.
This procedure presents an intrinsic limitation: when dealing with real data sets, one typically
does not know which model of evolution is the most suitable for them. A possible way out is to
compare algorithmic inference with expert classifications. This is the point of view we take here
by conducting a thorough survey of the accuracy of reconstruction methods as compared with the
Ethnologue expert classifications. We focus in particular on state-of-the-art distance-based
methods for phylogeny reconstruction using worldwide linguistic databases. In order to assess the
accuracy of the inferred trees we introduce and characterize two generalizations of standard
definitions of distances between trees. Based on these scores we quantify the relative performances
of the distance-based algorithms considered. Further we quantify how the completeness and the
coverage of the available databases affect the accuracy of the reconstruction. Finally we draw some
conclusions about where the accuracy of the reconstructions in historical linguistics stands and
about the leading directions to improve it. """
