abstract = """
The evolution of spoken languages has been studied since the
mid-nineteenth century using traditional historical comparative methods and, more
recently, computational phylogenetic methods. By contrast, evolutionary processes
resulting in the diversity of contemporary sign languages (SLs) have received
much less attention, and scholars have been largely unsuccessful in grouping SLs
into monophyletic language families using traditional methods. To date, no
published studies have attempted to use language data to infer relationships
among SLs on a large scale. Here, we report the results of a phylogenetic
analysis of 40 contemporary and 36 historical SL manual alphabets coded for
morphological similarity. Our results support grouping SLs in the sample into six
main European lineages, with three larger groups of Austrian, British and French
origin, as well as three smaller groups centring around Russian, Spanish and
Swedish. The British and Swedish lineages support current knowledge of
relationships among SLs based on extra-linguistic historical sources. With
respect to other lineages, our results diverge from current hypotheses by
indicating (i) independent evolution of Austrian, French and Spanish from Spanish
sources; (ii) an internal Danish subgroup within the Austrian lineage; and (iii)
evolution of Russian from Austrian sources.
