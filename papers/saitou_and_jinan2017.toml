abstract = """
The Japanese Archipelago stretches over 4000 km from north to south, and is the
homeland of three human populations; Ainus, Mainlanders, and Okinawans. The
origins of these people have been studied for a long time. The standard theory
based on craniofacial data is the "dual structure model" propagated by Japanese
physical anthropologists, notably Hanihara (1991). According to this model, first
migrants to the Japanese Archipelago came from somewhere in Southeast Asia
in Upper Paleolithic age more than 30,000 years ago, and were probably
ancestors of the Jomon people. The second wave of migration is believed to have
taken place later in the Yayoi period (3000-1700 BP), where the people arrived
from Northeast Asia. Indigenous Jomon people and new migrants in and after
Yayoi period gradually mixed with each other. This model provides a reasonable
explanation for the morphological similarity between the Ainu people of
Hokkaido at the northernmost main island of Japanese Archipelago, and the
Okinawan people in Southwest Archipelago, despite of large geographical
distance. Similarity of these peoples was already noticed more than one hundred
years ago by von Baelz (1911) who proposed the Ainu-Okinawan common
origin theory.
