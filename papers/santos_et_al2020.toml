abstract = """
To reconstruct aspects of human demographic history, linguistics and genetics complement
each other, reciprocally suggesting testable hypotheses on population relationships and
interactions. Relying on a linguistic comparative method exclusively based on syntactic
data, here we focus on the complex relation of genes and languages among Finno-Ugric (FU)
speakers, in comparison to their Indo-European (IE) and Altaic (AL) neighbors. Syntactic
analysis supports three distinct clusters corresponding to these three Eurasian families;
yet, the outliers of the FU group show linguistic convergence with their geographical
neighbors. By analyzing genome-wide data in both ancient and contemporary populations, we
uncovered remarkably matching patterns, with north-western FU speakers linguistically and
genetically closer in parallel degrees to their IE-speaking neighbors, and eastern FU
speakers to AL-speakers. Therefore, our study indicates plausible secondary convergence
in the syntax of languages of different families, providing evidence that such
interference effects were accompanied, and possibly caused, by recognizable processes at
the population level. In particular, based on the comparison of modern and ancient
genomes, our analysis identified the Pontic-Caspian steppes as the possible origin of the
demographic processes that led to the expansion of the FU into Europe.
