abstract = """
Ancestral State Reconstruction (ASR) is an essential part of historical
linguistics (HL). Conventional ASR in HL relies on three core principles:
fewest changes on the tree, plausibility of changes and plausibility of the
resulting combinations of features in proto-languages. This approach has
some problems, in particular the definition of what is plausible and the
disregard for branch lengths. This study compares the classic approach of
ASR to computational tools (Maximum Parsimony and Maximum
Likelihood), conceptually and practically. Computational models have the
advantage of being more transparent, consistent and replicable, and the
disadvantage of lacking nuanced knowledge and context. Using data from
the structural database Grambank, I compare reconstructions of the
grammar of ancestral Oceanic languages from the HL literature to those
achieved by computational means. The results show that there is a high
degree of agreement between manual and computational approaches, with
a tendency for classical HL to ignore branch lengths. Explicitly taking
branch lengths into account is more conceptually sound; as such the field of
HL should engage in improving methods in this direction. A combination
of computational methods and qualitative knowledge is possible in the
future and would be of great benefit.
