abstract = """
Recent advances in automated assessment of basic vocabulary lists allow the construction of linguistic phylogenies
useful for tracing dynamics of human population expansions, reconstructing ancestral cultures, and modeling
transition rates of cultural traits over time. 

Here we investigate the Tupi expansion, a widely-dispersed language family in lowland South America, with a
distance-based phylogeny based on 40-word vocabulary lists from 48 languages. We coded 11 cultural traits across
the diverse Tupi family including traditional warfare patterns, post-marital residence, corporate structure,
community size, paternity beliefs, sibling terminology, presence of canoes, tattooing, shamanism, men's houses,
and lip plugs.

The linguistic phylogeny supports a Tupi homeland in west-central Brazil with subsequent major expansions across
much of lowland South America. Consistently, ancestral reconstructions of cultural traits over the linguistic
phylogeny suggest that social complexity has tended to decline through time, most notably in the independent
emergence of several nomadic hunter-gatherer societies. Estimated rates of cultural change across the Tupi
expansion are on the order of only a few changes per 10,000 years, in accord with previous cultural phylogenetic
results in other language families around the world, and indicate a conservative nature to much of human culture.
