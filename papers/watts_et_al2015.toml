abstract = """
Supernatural belief presents an explanatory challenge to evolutionary theoristsâ€”it is both
costly and prevalent. One influential functional explanation claims that the imagined
threat of supernatural punishment can suppress selfishness and enhance cooperation.
Specifically, morally concerned supreme deities or 'moralizing high gods' have been argued
to reduce free-riding in large social groups, enabling believers to build the kind of
complex societies that define modern humanity. Previous cross-cultural studies claiming to
support the MHG hypothesis rely on correlational analyses only and do not correct for the
statistical non-independence of sampled cultures. Here we use a Bayesian phylogenetic
approach with a sample of 96 Austronesian cultures to test the MHG hypothesis as well as
an alternative supernatural punishment hypothesis that allows punishment by a broad range
of moralizing agents. We find evidence that broad supernatural punishment drives political
complexity, whereas MHGs follow political complexity. We suggest that the concept of MHGs
diffused as part of a suite of traits arising from cultural exchange between complex
societies. Our results show the power of phylogenetic methods to address long-standing
debates about the origins and functions of religion in human society.
