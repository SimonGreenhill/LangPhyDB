title = "How to use typological databases in historical linguistic research"

abstract = """
Several databases have been compiled with the aim of documenting the distribution of
typological features across the world's languages. This paper looks at ways of utilizing
this type of data for making inferences concerning genealogical relationships by using
phylogenetic algorithms originally developed for biologists. The focus is on methodology,
including how to assess the stability of individual typological features and the
suitability of different phylogenetic algorithms, as well as ways to enhance phylogenetic
signals and heuristic procedures for identifying genealogical relationships. The various
issues are illustrated by a small sample of empirical data from a set of Native American
languages.
